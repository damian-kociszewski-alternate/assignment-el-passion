# 1

Your task is to code template for Github issues application. Try to reproduce application design as much as you can,
doing it in “pixel perfect” way.

Requirements:

- template needs to have all essential elements like: sidebar, navigation with filters, main frame with issues list, OSX
  buttons
- filter buttons in navigation should have hover and active state
- the star in single issue bar needs to be clikable and change it’s state after click (as it is in design)

Recommendations:

- pay attention to proper usage of HTML elements and CSS styles
- look to appropriate class naming according to known conventions
- try to code template in such a way that it can be applied to real application
- write code in component way - elements need to be reusable
- you don’t need to change scrollbar!

When you're ready, send us a link to your GitHub repository. Any questions? Feel free to contact us!

The template needs to have all essential elements like sidebar, navigation with filters, mainframe with issues list,
OSX-like buttons. Filter buttons in navigation should have hover and active state. The star in the single-issue bar
needs to be clickable and change its state after click (as it is in design). All changes done in the project should be
committed to GIT repository. The task concerns only the layout/template. Please do not include any business logic.

Recommendations:
Pay attention to proper usage of HTML elements and CSS styles. Look to an appropriate class naming according to the
known conventions. Try to code a template in such a way that it can be applied to a real application. Write your code in
component way - elements need to be reusable. You don’t need to change the scrollbar!
When you complete the assignment, please send us a link to Github repo.

Hint: what we'd like to see the most is your styling, so don’t waste time doing the whole application, a layout will be
sufficient.
